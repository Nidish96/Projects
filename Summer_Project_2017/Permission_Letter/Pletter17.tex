  \opening{Respected Sir,}
  \begin{center}
    (\underline{SUB}: Permissions request for summer stay )
  \end{center}
  
  As part of the activities of the FOSS Group of IIST, we are holding a
  few mini-projects for interested students over the summer (May-July,
  2017).

  Attached is a list of students along with their contact details who
  will be staying at IIST for around one month before the odd semester
  officially begins. We would be grateful if necessary permissions are
  granted to facilitate their stay at IIST in this period. Dr Vineeth
  B S will be the official faculty guide for the students during their
  stay here. The exact dates for which the permissions are requested
  are given below:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
      \textbf{Start Date:}&\textbf{24 June, 2017}\\
      \textbf{End Date:}&\textbf{24 July, 2017}
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}


  One of the main objectives of the group is to further the cause for
  computer literacy among IISTians and equip the students better from
  the computational side for their academics. Providing needful
  assistance will be greatly appreciated.
  \closing{Sincerely,\\
    Coordinating Members,\\
    FOSS Group, IIST}
